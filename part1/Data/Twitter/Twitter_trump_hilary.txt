Biden later threatened to withhold $1-B in USAid to Ukraine if they

Secretary of Labor?
If you voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, for Democrats in 2018, and
are going to vote for the Democratic nominee in 2020, YOU ARE
NOT “WHY DEMS LOSE” OR “WHY WE HAVE TRUMP.”

Do not accept this bullshit accusation from people who just want you

Release the Mueller Report (minus any National Security issues that
need retractions)

If Trump is innocent, then he should want it released. Then we can all
see it and move on

The Starr Report on Bill Clinton was released and this should too.
In 2016, the Democratic establishment ran Hillary Clinton. In 2020,
the Dem establishment is running multiple neoliberals/corporate
Democrats against Bernie Sanders, the most popular politician.
Why? Why wouldn't the DNC want to get behind Bernie who can
beat Trump? <U+0001F914>

I’m sick of the Democrats saying President Trump is inappropriate:

- Ted Kennedy left a women to die in a river

- Bill Clinton had oral sex in the Oval Office with a barely intern

- Obama ran guns to cartels and gave billions to terrorists

- Biden fondles women

President Trump should announce he will release his taxes only if
Hillary Clinton produces the 33,000 emails she deleted detailing her
pay to play arrangements as Secretary of State.

@jengerson Donald Trump, whom I do not like or support in any

question was solely about her support of Clinton’s position.

taxes... he didn't pay any federal income tax…”

@HillaryClinton People are asking?? Who can beat trump?
Overwhelming answer, Hillary Clinton, 2020 is your year, it took
Reagan 3 tries, beat this jerk and then rub it in!
Benghazi, Fast &amp; Furious, IRS targeting
conservatives.....Obama, Clinton's illegal emails and security
violations, FBI, FISA Courts warrants on Trump Campaign, cash sent
to Iran...to start https://t.co/7BsoNxIOfz

Release the Mueller Report (minus any National Security issues that
need retractions)

If Trump is innocent, then he should want it released. Then we can all
see it and move on

The Starr Report on Bill Clinton was released and this should too.
My response to any Dems questioning whether someone in Trump’s
staff deserves security clearance would be: Did Hillary Clinton lose
her security clearance after exposing 100 classified docs to Russia,
China, North Korea &amp; Anthony Wiener’s laptop? No? Then shut
your pie holes.

indict her, we must now HELP TRUMP SOME MORE by refusing to
provide..transparency about an investigation that goes to the very

@josephcollins77 This entire investigation stems from the obstructive
behaviors of the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration.

This is not a search for justice, it is a search for anything useful to
support candidates running against Donald Trum
In 1998, Rep.Jerry Nadler strongly opposed the release of the Starr
Report on Bill Clinton. No information whatsoever would or could be
legally released. But with the NO COLLUSION Mueller Report, which
the Dems hate, he wants it all. NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY
THEM! @foxandfriends
@BillKristol In which universe is Trump better than Clinton?
@BillKristol Sincere question: What has Trump done that's good?
(Set aside the stock market is doing well; that's in spite of what
Trump's done, not because of what he's done).

So, how can you assert Trump is better than Clinton?

Did you know:

Joe Biden's son was named a director to Ukraine's largest private
gas producer following a Ukrainian visit.

Biden later threatened to withhold $1-B in USAid to Ukraine if they
didn't fire a prosecutor looking into his son’s company

More people believe Hillary colluded with Russia than that Trump did.
And there's better evidence for it too:

On the avuncular horniness of Joe Biden, which we've accepted in
part because it's been so public, seeing it as part of his political
schtick.

Let’s also be clear about what we already know. Several of these
members were “manipulated” by Russians and Russian agents
saying ‘we want to help Trump win with stolen dirt on Hillary Clinton,
if you’re game.’ And they said ‘yes, we are game.'

@Bornabrit1 @dewhirst_v If a Dem did this-they'd have been
impeached before lunchtime. Trump threw a total bitch fit when AG
Lynch and Bill Clinton bumped into each other in public for just
minutes.

Trump lies about the things we can clearly see-video
If you voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, for Democrats in 2018, and
are going to vote for the Democratic nominee in 2020, YOU ARE
NOT “WHY DEMS LOSE” OR “WHY WE HAVE TRUMP.”

Do not accept this bullshit accusation from people who just want you
to shut up about their fave.
Cloture votes required in the first 2 years of a presidency:

Clinton: 8

Bush: 4

Obama: 12

Trump: 128

See anything off?

It's time for @SenateDems to STOP abusing Senate rules and
wasting precious floor time to obstruct @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump's well-qualified nominees.

Yeah....NO! Why even tweet this? No logical intelligent person would
argue Trump’s better than Clinton, or imply he’s accomplished
anything of merit during 24 months in office. I think I get your point,
but I question your motivation phrasing your tweet this way. He’s
nuts! https://t.co/73GtXeKCX0

Hillary Clinton: “Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all
of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal
taxes... he didn't pay any federal income tax…”

At which point, Trump interjected: “That makes me smart”.
