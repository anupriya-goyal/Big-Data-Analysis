Did your party win? Great. Accept it. Don't gloat.  Did your party lose? Too bad. Accept it.  Don't badmouth. The future cannot be predicted by the past.  If that was true, I might not have been allowed to vote at all.
I was given a choice on my future, my freedom, and I was allowed to vote based on my mind, not my gender, my colour, or my lineage. I was never a victim of oppression being told I had no choice in my government.

@GregClark4AB @doug_schweitzer Itâ€™s a terrible shame that the NDP split the vote.  You are the most pragmatic and honourable politician I have met.  Best of luck in your future endeavours Greg.
Put another way, Sanders has a habit of letting others do the heavy lifting and then swooping in the day of a vote with minor changes he can add to his legislative CV. Hereâ€™s a list of his amendments. Noticeably missing is virtually anything of note related to his platform.

You can't say "Vote Like A Black  Woman" then toss mediocre white men in their faces who don't have a resume in the black community. Black women by 94% didn't just voted for Hillary Clinton, they defended her because she had a consistent record in Black America since the 1960s.
I don't care who's offended, YOU can't win the Democratic Presidential Nomination without winning the Black vote. Thinking Black people will just vote, yeah we will, just not for you. Talking to Republicans before trying to break ground in Black America is not a winning strategy.

Sanders is notorious for amendments - even once dubbed the â€œRoll call (aka voice vote) kingâ€ - itâ€™s an odd claim to fame for someone who oft rails against incremental government and support for whom is based almost entirely on those unsuccessful sweeping programs you mentioned. https://t.co/9zDtMH5hZp
Put another way, Sanders has a habit of letting others do the heavy lifting and then swooping in the day of a vote with minor changes he can add to his legislative CV. Hereâ€™s a list of his amendments. Noticeably missing is virtually anything of note related to his platform.

Bernie Sanders have a lot of fucking nerves. This is the same man that railed against the millionaires while heâ€™s a millionaire himself. Thatâ€™s why he didnâ€™t released his taxes in 2016. For the people who thinks that we should vote Blue no matter who can kiss my black ass.

One result we can report already: The province-wide Student Vote. 165,000 elementary and high school students participated in the mock election. Students handed Kenney 49 'seats' to the NDP's 35 and the Alberta Party's 3. Liberals were shut out by the kids. #abvote

You can't say "Vote Like A Black  Woman" then toss mediocre white men in their faces who don't have a resume in the black community. Black women by 94% didn't just voted for Hillary Clinton, they defended her because she had a consistent record in Black America since the 1960s.

Sanders is notorious for amendments - even once dubbed the â€œRoll call (aka voice vote) kingâ€ - itâ€™s an odd claim to fame for someone who oft rails against incremental government and support for whom is based almost entirely on those unsuccessful sweeping programs you mentioned. https://t.co/9zDtMH5hZp
Put another way, Sanders has a habit of letting others do the heavy lifting and then swooping in the day of a vote with minor changes he can add to his legislative CV. Hereâ€™s a list of his amendments. Noticeably missing is virtually anything of note related to his platform.
A powerful (if defeasible), vaguely Kantian criterion for an ethical act is one that would not result in disaster if everyone did the same. Consider then what would happen if everyone thought, "She's a decent candidate, but she's not electable... better vote for a white man."
"NEW: Beto Oâ€™Rourke defended his 2015 vote to lift the oil export ban, even as the U.S. is poised to eclipse Saudi Arabia as the worldâ€™s top exporter. His record of voting with the GOP on fossil fuel bills casts a shadow over his 2020 climate credibility.

Sanders is notorious for amendments - even once dubbed the â€œRoll call (aka voice vote) kingâ€ - itâ€™s an odd claim to fame for someone who oft rails against incremental government and support for whom is based almost entirely on those unsuccessful sweeping programs you mentioned. https://t.co/9zDtMH5hZp
Put another way, Sanders has a habit of letting others do the heavy lifting and then swooping in the day of a vote with minor changes he can add to his legislative CV. Hereâ€™s a list of his amendments. Noticeably missing is virtually anything of note related to his platform.

@SallyAlbright Roughly 50% of voters vote. Of the 50% who do, I think it would be generous to say 1 in 4 is currently paying close attention. Don't be fooled by the Twitter echo chamber.

First-Past-The-Post hurts smaller parties. For example, the Alberta Party is on track to earn 10% of the vote â€” but will win zero seats. Not fair or representative of the vote. We need proportional representation in Canada.
Put another way, Sanders has a habit of letting others do the heavy lifting and then swooping in the day of a vote with minor changes he can add to his legislative CV. Hereâ€™s a list of his amendments. Noticeably missing is virtually anything of note related to his platform.

If you're not trying to swing the Black vote, especially Black women, you're doing all wrong. Who ever can mobilize a foundation of the black vote wins the Democratic party nomination. Entertaining Republicans is not going to sit well with Black people especially in the south.

The conflict in Yemen is a horrific humanitarian crisis that challenges the conscience of the entire world. Yet the President has cynically chosen to contravene a bipartisan, bicameral vote of the Congress &amp; perpetuate Americaâ€™s shameful involvement in this heartbreaking crisis.

Put another way, Sanders has a habit of letting others do the heavy lifting and then swooping in the day of a vote with minor changes he can add to his legislative CV. Hereâ€™s a list of his amendments. Noticeably missing is virtually anything of note related to his platform.
Sanders is notorious for amendments - even once dubbed the â€œRoll call (aka voice vote) kingâ€ - itâ€™s an odd claim to fame for someone who oft rails against incremental government and support for whom is based almost entirely on those unsuccessful sweeping programs you mentioned. https://t.co/9zDtMH5hZp
@etownmiller @AlbertaParty I'm kinda stunned at no seats either. They have a solid platform and I thought those not finding what they want in either party would vote more moderately. I voted Alberta party and I think my candidate had 335 out of 5800 votes
@Dolemite15 @tinkerbelledc Ditto, what I hate is that living in a red state means my presidential vote does not count. Time to make each vote count do away with electoral college
@libphil_ @2closetocall @ElectionsAB @joececiyyc Of ~700,000 Albertans who advance voted, 223,000+ were at a polling station outside the voterâ€™s riding. Officials wonâ€™t count those â€œvote anywhereâ€ ballots until Wed, meaning final results for close

Frustrated with the first past the post system. Alberta Party got 10%+ of the popular vote and 0 seats? How are those Albertanâ€™s represented?
@Norlaine @Jackstar009 @JDom33 The majority of Albertans are conservative. Theyâ€™d vote for a turd if you wrote conservative on it. But this time they have no idea what kind of conservative they voted for. But theyâ€™re about to find out.

HB19-1004 is an innovative way to use the state's existing infrastructure to reduce costs &amp; increase choice so our entire state has access to affordable &amp; high quality healthcare. Tell your Senator to move healthcare forward w/ a public option and vote yes on HB19-1004!
It is maddening that despite widespread community uproar against the bill and embarrassing news coverage, the Tennessee House still voted to criminalize volunteers that are helping citizens register to vote. This is not what democracy looks like.
