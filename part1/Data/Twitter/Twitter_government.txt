In the debate over how the government should work,
they consistently criticized the citizens and thought the
wealthy made much more responsible keepers of
liberty. They were wrong. Wealth doesn't show talent, it
doesn't show acumen. All it shows is wealth.
It's a mistake to say the Founders meant to prevent a
Donald Trump from becoming president. They
designed our government specifically to be run by and
for the wealthy. The mistake they made was in thinking
that the wealthy were inherently more talented or more
capable.

Context: 15 or higher means "clinical" trauma.
Filing asserts that the US "government intentionally
inflicted the severe harm caused by forcible separation
on families, like APF and OPD, who crossed the U.S.
border. The government did so to deter future
immigrants from coming to the United States."

Last line of the filing:_x000D_
