the party is its #membership and, by extension, all
of its #voters and #supporters. If politicians fail to
remember that, they will be painfully reminded at

Left-wing parties can't work well forever, right-wing
parties can't work well forever, even socialists or
centrists can't work well forever. And I also talk
about environmentalists and animalists, there's no
political party that can work well forever, it's absurd
to think so.
Of how people position themselves in favor of one
or the other and fight among themselves defending
that one political party is better than the other. And
I've realized that this really is nonsense, because
to think that a single political party can work well is
a complete utopia
. Every political party has its faults, they're
designed like this because society is changing,
evolving, it's not static. The political elections serve
for that, so that the citizens can analyze at what
moment we're, what problems exist and which is
the political party that

better adapts to the current needs._x000D_
The problem comes from the conviction that only
one political party can work well and, something
that should be rotating, suddenly stagnates. Or it
goes from one extreme to another, thinking that
this is the solution.

Youâ€™ll know if a primary is partisan or
nonpartisan by checking on your local elections
office website or if youâ€™re asked to identify your
political party when you check in to vote--and are

In a nonpartisan primary, voters choose from all of
the candidates running for a position, regardless of
their political party. Generally, the candidates who
received the most votes go on to the general
election.
Primary elections are either partisan or non-

candidate from a political party they would like to
represent that political party in the general election.

@RealCandaceO Racism - Prejudice,
discrimination, antagonism against someone of a
different race (INCLUDES Caucasians?)? RACISM
IS A 2-WAY STREET. The word &amp; its ugliness
is used by The Democrat Party 4 political purposes
to divide people &amp; cause
@Anjupang Itâ€™s only difficult if you value the
political party over the country.
Hypocrisy in one's political party should be called
out, not shushed like some sort of dirty family
secret. I want to be proud of my party, not revolted
by it.
@moebius_strip Ain't no party like political party
stunts.
Always serving for the greater good. We represent
not only our political party, but also the people who
have the same principles and beliefs as us, and
who fight for the things we wish to stand for in this
journey, even outside FEU. I'm glad I'm here.

@fred_guttenberg @darknessn2light That's what
happens when law officials are elected. I have
never understood how an elected, therefore
political, official can be unbiased. Of COURSE they
are not unbiased, that's the whole point of owing a
political party
This...along with my anecdotal adventures in
pothole avoidance in Omaha this weekend. We

If only one political party didn't think it was better
instead to ALWAYS give the very rich and
corporations a massive tax cut.

@realDonaldTrump How true is this statement! If
they let the President win on anything they loose
the election all over again. How childish on the
political hacks of the defunct Democratic Party.
I firmly believe some should never discount the
view expressed by another simply because that
individual(s) belong to a different political party.
Thatâ€™s biased thinking. One must objectively
determine the facts, the law(s) &amp; regulation(s)
governing issue at hand &amp; then decide.

political party is better in 2019, after all the dirty
politics we have seen from both sides... I hate to

It's just clear proof that his leadership is really that
terrible to the point of even most people in his own
political party hate him. Why he's still in the oval
office is unbelievable. He won't be around much
longer
@LordMVee @actpsy @KazzJenkins Totally but
people are being lied to and held to ransom. Then
they suggest a council tax be levied against the
public, which is illegal. In reality we have an outlaw
private political party in office.
Strategy and conversation does not make a
political party! #qanda
@lmwashburn Iâ€™m furious at those who would
take advantage of that for political gain; especially
those within the Party. VP Biden is not my

Similarly, the #Hebrew word for "political party,"
miflaGA, comes from PLG, "split, divide." This word
originally referred to a military division. This sense
remains in pluGA, "military company." PEleg,
"brook," also comes from this root. #etymology
#language #politics 3/? https://t.co/64Abg3xHC2
Although in a #party, people get together, the word
"party" comes from an Old #French word meaning
"that which is divided" (a cognate of "part"). This is
reflected in the political and legal senses of the
word. _x000D_
