Primary elections are either partisan or
non-partisan. In a partisan primary,
voters choose which candidate from a
political party they would like to
represent that political party in the
general election.
Youâ€™ll know if a primary is partisan
or nonpartisan by checking on your local
elections office website or if youâ€™re
asked to identify your political party
when you check in to vote--and are
given a ballot labeled for that political
party.
To learn more about primaries and why
theyâ€™re important, read our Medium

elections. So, what are they? Primary

us every midterm election until 2018,

They are not really a party geared for

is winning more seats and is now the

great if we had Dem leadership that
could contest illegitimate elections and
figure out how to avoid being out
maneuvered on judicial appointments
and in general avoid being played by the

Recoiling from civil rights laws &amp;
activists, a majority of white voters in '68
refused to vote for the Democratic
POTUS candidate. That's held true for
13 straight Presidential elections.
Trump's the logical result. So to those
who say "This isn't who we are,"
remember:
Foreign election interference is not only
a serious threat to our democratic
institutions, itâ€™s a threat to our
national security. Russia and other
authoritarian regimes are actively
seeking to try to change outcomes of
our democratic elections, and we
canâ€™t allow that to happen.

Kemp signed #HB316 on Tuesday,

obvious that Kemp knows #HB316 will
